# Unit 3: A Clothing Factory GUI

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

The client is the manager of a clothes making factory that produces shirts in three different colors (red, blue, yellow). He suffers from frequent short term memory loss which causes him to misplace and lose raw materials frequently, in addition to forgetting how much money he has. This therefore results in losses for the factory as they take on orders they do not have the supply to meet, costing them their reputation and clients. He also forgets the amount of materials needed to make his goods and how much they sell for, especially because there are different formulas depending on the color. This causes him to order the wrong amount of raw materials. He tried keeping track on paper, but it became tedious and inefficient.

## Proposed Solution

**Design statement**

``` Fill out here```

## Success Criteria
1. A page that keeps track of how much money the client has (Issue Tackled: "forgetting how much money he has")
2. A page that shows the current inventory of the factory (Issue Tackled: "misplace and lose raw materials")
3. A page that allows the client to create his product (Issue Tackled: "")
4. A cost table that shows how much raw material is needed to make each product (Issue Tackled: "forgets the amount of materials needed to make his goods")
5. 
6.
